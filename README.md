# QuickJobs Frontend

QuickJobs Frontend is a web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that serves as the user interface for the QuickJobs platform. The platform is designed to connect job seekers with employers, streamline the job search process, and provide a modern, responsive experience for users.

## Project Overview

QuickJobs Frontend provides the following core features:

- **Job Listings:** Users can browse and search for available job opportunities, filter by category, location, and other criteria.
- **Job Details:** Each job listing includes detailed information such as job description, requirements, company profile, and application instructions.
- **User Authentication:** Job seekers and employers can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
- **Application Management:** Job seekers can apply for jobs directly through the platform, track their applications, and receive notifications.
- **Employer Dashboard:** Employers can post new job openings, manage existing listings, and review applications from candidates.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience across platforms.
- **Modern UI:** Utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimized font loading.
- **Chat Feature:** Enables real-time messaging between job seekers and employers, allowing direct communication regarding job opportunities, interviews, and application status.
